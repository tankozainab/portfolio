## 🧠 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Responsive Design Across Devices**
**Challenge:** Ensuring the website looked good on both mobile and desktop screens.  
**Solution:** Used flexible layouts with CSS media queries and percentage-based widths. Also tested on various screen sizes to fine-tune alignment and spacing.

---

### 2. **Smooth Scrolling Behavior**
**Challenge:** Getting navigation links to scroll smoothly to sections instead of jumping.  
**Solution:** Added `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in the CSS and structured section IDs properly to enable smooth anchor linking.

---

### 3. **Animations Without Overload**
**Challenge:** Using animations to enhance, not distract from, content.  
**Solution:** Used simple, lightweight CSS animations and transitions to create subtle visual effects that maintain performance and focus.

---

### 4. **Form Handling and Validation**
**Challenge:** Preventing users from submitting incomplete or invalid information.  
**Solution:** Added basic JavaScript validation to ensure that required fields are filled and data formats are correct before submission.

---

### 5. **Deployment via GitHub Pages**
**Challenge:** Making sure all assets (images, CSS, JS) loaded properly after deployment.  
**Solution:** Double-checked relative paths and used consistent file structure. Used GitHub Pages for easy and free hosting.
